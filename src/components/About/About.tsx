                    My real acquaintance with software took place in my university life. In this process, although I learned and interested in many different software languages, I developed myself mostly in JavaScript. I am currently in the field of Web Development. The technologies I use the most are React.js and Node.js. I have developed many different projects to improve myself in this field.
